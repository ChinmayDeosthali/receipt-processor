# Receipt Processor API

## üìå Project Overview

The Receipt Processor API is a Spring Boot application that processes receipts and calculates reward points based on specific rules. The application provides two endpoints:

- **POST **``: Accepts a receipt JSON, assigns it a unique ID, and stores it in memory.
- **GET **``: Returns the points awarded for a given receipt ID.

The API is designed to run as a **Dockerized application**, ensuring easy deployment and portability.
